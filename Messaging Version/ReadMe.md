Gamer - Messaging Version

Difference between stand-alone and messaging.

Added service messaging to handle all I/O between "services".

Theory:

All nouns are services.
All actions are events.

The service boundaries need to be hardened.  The interface provides the only input mechanisims.

Nouns are subject to change as they move across service boundaries.  A player can mean something different in the database than it does in the client.
